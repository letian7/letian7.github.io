            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p> <b>Opening Statement:</b>
"Imagine a world where a minute-long video can start a global movement, shape fashion trends, and even influence political discourse. Welcome to the era of TikTok, a platform not just redefining entertainment but reshaping the very fabric of our society. From viral dances to powerful social movements, TikTok's impact extends far beyond its digital boundaries."<br>

<b>Contextualizing the Topic:</b>
"TikTok, originally perceived as a simple app for teenagers to share short, often humorous videos, has rapidly evolved into a cultural powerhouse with profound societal implications. Its unique algorithm has created a new type of digital community, where content can quickly gain worldwide attention. As we scrutinize TikTok's role in our daily lives, we begin to understand its multifaceted influence – from its impact on mental health to its role in shaping consumer behavior and creating new forms of social interaction. This platform is not just about entertainment; it's a reflection and driver of our times."<br>

<b>Presenting a Key Argument and Its Impact:</b>
"A key argument in understanding TikTok's societal impact is its role in democratizing content creation and consumption. Unlike traditional media, TikTok provides a platform where anyone can become a content creator and reach a global audience, regardless of their background or resources. This has led to the emergence of new voices and perspectives, particularly from marginalized communities, challenging the status quo of content creation. However, this democratization also raises concerns over misinformation, privacy, and the psychological effects of social media addiction. The impact of TikTok is thus a double-edged sword, offering unprecedented opportunities for creativity and expression while posing significant challenges to traditional norms and values."<br>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
"As we navigate the complex tapestry of TikTok's influence on society, it becomes clear that this platform is more than just an app – it's a cultural phenomenon that mirrors and molds our evolving society. As TikTok continues to grow, so too will its impact on various aspects of our lives. Whether this influence will be viewed as a positive force or a challenging disruption remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that TikTok has forever altered the landscape of social media and its role in our daily lives, marking a new chapter in the digital age. As we conclude this exploration, we're left with a deeper understanding of TikTok's multifaceted impact and the responsibility that comes with such a powerful tool at our fingertips." </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Accessibility</h2>
             <h3>The different between closed-captions and transcripts</h3>
            <p>  <br>Closed-Captioning: Closed captions are text versions of the spoken words and other relevant sounds in a video. They are essential for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, as they provide a written display of the dialogue and other auditory information.<br>

Transcripts: A transcript is a text version of the audio in a video. It includes dialogue and may also describe important non-speech elements. Transcripts are useful not only for accessibility but also for those who prefer to read rather than listen..</p>
<h3>Task 2 WEBVTT</h3>
<p> WebVtt is the file of subtitle the video. I must transcript from audio or video to text, then generate the webvtt file.The following picture is the inside of webvtt file, you need have the time zone and text.</p>
<img src="webvtt.png" alt="tiktok app" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
<h3>Task 3: What about other forms of accessibility?</h3>
<p>Text-to-Speech Functionality: Recognizing that not all users can read text on a screen, I included a text-to-speech option. This feature allows users to listen to the content, making it accessible to individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties.<br>

Keyboard Navigation: To support users who cannot use a mouse, the entire website was designed to be navigable using keyboard shortcuts. This includes accessible drop-down menus and tab-accessible elements.<br>

Customizable Font Sizes and Contrast Options: Users have the option to adjust font sizes and contrast settings according to their preferences. This personalization supports users with visual impairments and enhances readability.<br>

Alt Text for All Visual Media: Every image, infographic, and video thumbnail includes descriptive alt text. This ensures screen readers can convey the content of these visuals to users who are blind or have low vision.<br>

Closed Captioning for Videos: All embedded videos feature closed captioning, catering to users who are deaf or hard of hearing. This also benefits users who prefer reading over listening.</p>
