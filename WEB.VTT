 So far this year, the 

global tech industry has laid off more than 170, 000 people. Where do the unemployed workers go for comfort? Thousands choose TikTok. 
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:025.94
That said,  congratulations, you've 

00:00:31.83 --> 00:00:052.09
The thing with TikTok is it's so easy to go viral these days that  it's really opened up this idea where people can just turn their cameras on, hit record, start talking about how they got fired, how they got laid off, talk about the raw emotions that are going on. After losing her job as a tech recruiter, Bailey TikTok.

Then 10 minutes later, he hits me with that. I'm so sorry. Bailey's second TikTok video ever has now been viewed more than 447, 000 times. So yeah, I'm unemployed, but I have a hell of a lot of confidence in myself. I want to help you land another job after leaving your toxic one. Career coach Jonathan Javier has actually used the power of TikTok to help many of his clients land jobs.

There's so much. Aspects of going viral on the platform and hiring managers and recruiters all the time are reaching out to these candidates saying, Hey, I saw your video on TikTok. There's so much ability to find work, especially on TikTok. He says besides LinkedIn, TikTok is the next best social media tool for connecting with people to find work.

00:01:14.21 --> 00:01:033.15
You never know who is going to see your content and you're never going to know who's going to see those skills and experiences that you could see on a piece of paper. But imagine the eyes that could be seen on that resume or on your profile. You have the potential. to reach hundreds of thousands of people rather than applying to just jobs. 

While many of these videos poke fun at a serious situation, one Salting CEO advises people not to bash their former employer. Because that could leave recruiters wondering if they do the same thing to their company. But some people are naming their former employers, and for those who don't, it's not hard to find out who they actually work for.
00:01:33.71 --> 00:01:054.71
So could that change the way companies fire people in the future?  This is the first time in history where people can turn on their camera and go viral and talk about their experience. I think in the past, mainstream media really owned that narrative. Tech companies got to own that narrative. And so we're really seeing a shift in, I don't, I don't want to say power, but at least like Who gets to tell the story?
00:01:33.71 --> 00:01:054.71
Judge says while it can be either the employer or employee who is at fault for the layoff, this new era of TikTok posting has the potential to make the firing process more transparent for all. I got laid off.  It's a little crazy how things work out. Mark New, CGTN, San Francisco.
